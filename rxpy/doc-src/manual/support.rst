Support
=======

RXPY is still in alpha development and I can provide very little support.  If
you want to ask questions it's probably best to use the Lepl mailing list
at `<http://groups.google.com/group/lepl>`_.

Documentation
-------------

The simplest way to view the documentation is via the `web
<http://www.acooke.org/rxpy>`_ (contents :ref:`here <contents>`).  However,
you can also install a local copy.  Simply download and unpack the appropriate
files (see :ref:`download`).
